1481214768,5896cc357ab64f2a6523dc3b2fa42b70,Form,6,0,exit,NULL,comments,I was getting pretty confused by this during the study. I was having trouble with sentences that mentioned a man such as "the businessman" and then using "herself" in the sentence. It simply wasn't making sense to me and initially I had thought it was a typo or something but it kept happening repeatedly. The sentence sounded natural except for that one piece and I started to gear my responses towards that. Good study. Thanks for the opportunity.
